# Assignment Activity Unit 7

## This assignment will assess your knowledge and skills about: 
- Developing and evaluating complex expressions for computational problems. 
- Analyzing evaluation strategies to optimize performance. 

### Scenario 
A city is developing a smart traffic management system designed to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion at major intersections. The system evaluates real-time data from traffic sensors, cameras, and user inputs to analyze traffic conditions and adjust signal timings. However, it faces challenges in processing this data efficiently, which could lead to delays and increased congestion. To ensure the system can deliver timely responses and maintain safety, the city needs to optimize its computations. 

## Based on the insights gained from this system, write expressions in Python or Java for the following tasks: 
1. Calculate the average waiting time for vehicles at an intersection based on data from traffic sensors.
2. Develop a relational expression to determine if the current traffic volume exceeds a safe threshold of 50 vehicles per minute.
3. Construct a Boolean expression to control traffic signals, defining conditions under which the light should turn green (e.g., if the average waiting time exceeds 60 seconds AND traffic count is greater than 40 vehicles).
4. Compare eager versus lazy evaluation approaches for processing traffic data, discussing trade-offs in speed and memory usage.
5. Which evaluation strategy—eager or lazy evaluation—would you recommend for effectively managing traffic, considering performance, accuracy, and scalability?
