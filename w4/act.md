# ***Developing recursive algorithms for data manipulation involving mutation and variables.***

## Assignment
Read the following scenario.

## Scenario
A digital library system is being developed using Python to organize books into a hierarchy of categories, subcategories, and individual books. The system must handle tasks such as calculating the total number of books in a category, updating book availability based on check-outs and returns, and restructuring categories and subcategories. 

## Based on the insights gained from this system, proceed with addressing the following tasks:  
Develop a code in Python that implements recursive algorithms for the following tasks: 
1. Count the total number of books within a specified category, including all its subcategories. 
2. Update the availability status of books, ensuring accurate reflection of check-outs and returns throughout the entire hierarchy. 
3. Relocate a category and all its subcategories to a new parent category, adjusting the hierarchy and updating all relevant references as needed.
