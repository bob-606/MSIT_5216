# ***Developing recursive algorithms for data manipulation involving mutation and variables.***

## Assignment
Read the following scenario.

## Scenario
A digital library system is being developed using Python to organize books into a hierarchy of categories, subcategories, and individual books. The system must handle tasks such as calculating the total number of books in a category, updating book availability based on check-outs and returns, and restructuring categories and subcategories. 

## Based on the insights gained from this system, proceed with addressing the following tasks:  
Develop a code in Python that implements recursive algorithms for the following tasks: 
1. Count the total number of books within a specified category, including all its subcategories. 
2. Update the availability status of books, ensuring accurate reflection of check-outs and returns throughout the entire hierarchy. 
3. Relocate a category and all its subcategories to a new parent category, adjusting the hierarchy and updating all relevant references as needed.

# Recursive Algorithms for Hierarchical Data Management
**Introduction**

The management of hierarchical data structures is a fundamental challenge in software design, particularly in systems like digital libraries that require efficient organization and manipulation of nested categories. Modern libraries often contain thousands of books organized into multi-level taxonomies (e.g., "Fiction → Science Fiction → Cyberpunk"), necessitating robust algorithms for tasks such as inventory tracking, availability updates, and structural reorganization. Recursive algorithms provide an elegant solution to these challenges by mirroring the inherent hierarchical nature of library systems (Wang, 2023).

This solution leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to model categories and books, combined with recursive traversal techniques for data manipulation. The implementation addresses three core requirements: (1) calculating total books in nested categories, (2) propagating availability updates across the hierarchy, and (3) dynamically restructuring category relationships. By integrating Python's native support for recursion with mutable object states, the system achieves both clarity and functionality (Krishnamurthi, 2017).
