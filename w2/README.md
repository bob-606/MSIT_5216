# Scenario 

A group at a tech company was developing a new programming language designed for educational purposes. The language aimed to be easy to understand, efficient in execution, and flexible enough for various programming tasks. They were tasked with designing the language's execution model, syntax, and semantics, while also building a prototype development environment using the Racket environment. Desugaring techniques were incorporated to simplify high-level constructs, enhancing the language's usability and performance for both beginners and advanced learners.  

---

## 1. Explaining the use of interpreters vs. Compilers. 
- Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using an interpreter versus a compiler for the language described in the introduction.   
- Explain the chosen execution model with diagrams and metrics. Justify how it meets the language's goals. 

## 2. Devising language syntax and semantics using formal methods. 
- Using formal methods and attribute grammars, specify the syntax and semantics of the language, as outlined in the introduction above.  
- Provide grammar rules and their meanings for the language. Include a code snippet and its semantic analysis.  

## 3. Adapting to the use of the Racket environment for creating new programming languages. 
- Implement a basic interpreter or compiler for your educational language in Racket.   
- Test it with sample programs, document the adaptation process and challenges, and provide a demonstration highlighting key features and functionality.
