# This assignment will assess your knowledge and skills about: 
1. Analyzing memory management and garbage collection to enhance performance.
2. Evaluating error handling mechanisms for program stability. 

## Assignment
Read the following scenario.    
### Scenario
A large-scale e-commerce platform, developed using either Python or Java, handles high traffic and processes multiple concurrent transactions. Performance issues have arisen, with frequent reports of slow response times and occasional crashes due to memory overflows. Additionally, during peak traffic times, the platform experiences unhandled exceptions, leading to instability and system crashes. 

### Given these challenges, please respond to the following questions to explore potential areas for improvement: 
1. How can the memory management system of the platform, built in Python or Java, be analyzed to improve performance?  
2. What role does garbage collection play in optimizing memory usage, and how can specific language-based strategies be implemented to ensure responsiveness even during high traffic periods? 
3. How can the platform's error handling mechanisms be evaluated and improved, particularly in a Python or Java environment?  
4. What best practices should be adopted to implement robust error handling, ensuring the platform remains stable and functional during peak traffic or when unexpected errors occur? 

## Submission Instructions
- Your Discussion should be between 1000 and 2000 words in length (not including the reference list).
- You may use the course readings or any relevant source when creating your response to the questions and your peer replies.
- Remember to locate, use, cite, and list references in all your discussion posts to validate statements of fact or corroborate personal opinions/points of view.
