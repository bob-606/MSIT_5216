### This assignment will assess your knowledge and skills about: 
Applying functional programming basics to solve complex problems with substitutions and scoping.   

### Scenario
A team was developing a task scheduling system using a functional programming language like Racket or Haskell. The system needed to manage user-created tasks and update schedules automatically as users made changes. It was important to handle variable scope and substitutions carefully to ensure that changes made by one user didn’t affect tasks in other users’ sessions by keeping everything organized and separate. 

### Based on the scenario, answer the questions below to guide your discussion: 
- How would you manage variable scope to ensure that task updates are isolated from the user's session and do not interfere with other sessions? 
- How can you use substitutions to handle dynamic task updates effectively within a functional programming environment?
